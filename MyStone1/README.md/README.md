# PrognosAI â€” Predictive Maintenance (Milestone 1)

**Overview**  
PrognosAI is an AI-based predictive maintenance system that predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using the NASA CMAPSS dataset.  
The goal is to prevent unexpected machine failures, reduce downtime, and improve industrial efficiency.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from time-series sensor data.
- Build a preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare data.
- Train deep learning models (LSTM/GRU) for predictive maintenance.
- Set up a simple, modular, and scalable workflow for industrial data.

---

## ðŸ§© Milestone 1 â€” Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
**Tasks Completed:**
- Loaded the NASA CMAPSS dataset.
- Cleaned and normalized sensor readings.
- Calculated RUL (Remaining Useful Life) for each engine.
- Created rolling window sequences for time-series model training.

**Deliverables:**
- Preprocessed dataset files (`data/` folder)
- RUL target values
- Python script for preprocessing and feature engineering
